The beginning of my website

I am glad that I am able to create the beginning of my portfolio website even though i still have a lot elements to implements. I am still struggling with sizing images and using quit a few div tags. I also think that I still have to work on how responsive the site is in smaller devices. Overall I am happy with this for the beginning, and I really learnt a lot especially doing own research, not necessarily relying on the class material.
